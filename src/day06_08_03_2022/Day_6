	Methods Intro : 	

			

	Task 1 :   Write a method that can check if a number is prime or not

				Note : Prime numbers are special numbers, greater than 1, that have exactly two factors, themselves and 1

     
	Task 2 :   Write a method that can check if a number is Armstrong number  

				Note: if I have a 3-digit number then each of the digits is raised to the power of three and added to obtain a number. If the number obtained equals the original number then, we call that armstrong number.

				Armstrong numbers are     === 153 370 371 407 === for 3 digits
